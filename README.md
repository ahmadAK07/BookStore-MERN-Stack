Hey! I'm Muhammad Ahmad:

First you need to create mongodb account to get the urI of your database in which you will write email and your password. You can learn the creation of this mongodb cluster from youtube.

To use this project you need to clone this project in your system whereever you want to use it then get inside the frontend project with command "cd frontend" and then enter </br>
the command "npm run dev" it will run the frontside of project. </br>
Then open another terminal to run the backend side. </br>
Run the command "cd backend" when you are in BookStore-MERN-Stack folder it will get you into backend folder. </br>
Where you have to run the same command "npm run dev" as you did in the frontend.

ThanksðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž
